# Numerical-Analysis-C
The programs are aimed at modelling different Mathematical Methods which help solve certain mathematical equations numerically. Solving equations this way is beneficial when we can't find an analytic solution to that particular equation. Also the results provide excellent approximations to their analytic counterparts and can be solved more easily. This repository contains codes mainly written in C.
